Membership-ravendb
==================

Simple Membership Provider for RavenDB. This is an almost exact implementation of the API for the provider, therefore should be almost plug &amp; play. If it is not, then there is a change on the newest versions that must be addressed. The source code also has an example using MVC 4 that supports the entire functionality.
